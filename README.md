# actuarialpreparationkit.github.io
Actuarial preparation kit is a free preparation tool for the preliminary actuarial exams. After working for a few years in the actuarial and software indstury, I was inspired to create a study tool like leetcode for the actuarial field. The site is focused around summarizing key topics for the actuarial field, providing interactive tools for performing calculationns and a community discussion forum. Get started by reading the one of the topics here.

## About the author

I studied actuarial science from 2012-2017 and obtained my ASA in 2018. I have since switched careers to software engineering. I wanted to build an interactive site that provided study materials which could be accessed in the browser. I enjoy mentoring others in software and actuarial science and this site was a way for me to to do that on a large scale. I designed and built the entire site. This is the most ambitious side project I have tried to do.

## About the site

Yes, there are a lot of actuarial study materials out there. The goal of the site is not to rewrite a separate version of every single topic on every exam. The goal is to focus on fundamentals of the actuarial profession and provide a summary of the big picture ideas. This site should not be your only study resource, but it can be a very helpful tool for gaining a better understanding of certain topics and finding practice questions and solutions. The community aspect of the site is very important. I do not have the time to maintain all the topics or write all the topics or tools, so providing a way for the community to easily collaborate with the site by writing posts on the site or adding features on GitHub.

Here are some unique features of this site:

* Searchable question database. Questions are either scraped from the Society of Actuaries past questions and exams or contributed by users of the site.
* Community forum. Students are able to post their own solutions to questions (using Markdown) or discuss interviews, etc. with each other.
<!-- similar functionality to Leetcode -->
* Javascript tools. Students are able to perform certain actuarial calculations in the browser using the provided site tools and view the code for these tools.
<!-- planned tools for annuities, binomial trees, mortality tables, and so on -->
* Site blog. Provide a blog on the development of the site, details on how the site is implemented and a history of changes made to the site. This would allows users of the site to get a better understanding of how the site is built.
